# TicTacToeBot

### Overview
This is an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe bot implementing the minimax algorithm in Rust.
This is my first time coding in Rust and I used this as a learning tool. 
Feel free to raise a pull request if there is a way I can improve it.
I intend on implementing alpha-beta pruning in the future.

### How to run
1. clone the repo

```git clone git@github.com:BobDylanSamsung/TicTacToeBot.git```
2. Go into directory

```cd TicTacToeBot```
3. Run the project

```cargo run```
